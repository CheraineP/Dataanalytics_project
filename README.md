# Data_analytics_project
This project is about the analysis of bank customers who have left their current bank (churner). I have used a range of analysis programmes such as SQL and Microsoft Excel, whilst creating visualisations from the analysis through Power Bi. I have also created a PowerPoint to presentation to go alongside my analysis and visualisations. 

About the data. 
•	Total number of customers - 10127
•	Total number of attired customers (churners) - 1627
•	Total Existing customers – 8500
•	Different education levels – high school, college, graduate, post-graduate, doctorate, unknown and uneducated.
•	Income categories – less than 40k, 40k -60k, 60k-80k, 80k-120k, 120k+
•	Different Card types – Blue, Silver, Gold and Platinum

From my analysis of the data I concluded several points:
•	Graduates (487 Churners) and High school (306 Churners) were the highest churners. Whilst Postgraduates (92) and Doctorates (95) were the least likely to churn.
•	People younger than 55 were the most likely to churn as this category had a total of 1332 churners with only 62 churners over the age of 55.
•	Married people were most likely to churn with 709 people churning, whilst divorced people were the least likely with only 121 people churning.
•	Females were the most likely to churn with 930 churning
•	People with 2 or fewer dependants were most likely to churn (821)
•	Customers who earnt less than 40k were the most likely to churn (612)
•	Blue Card customers were the most likely to churn.
•	Customers who churned, their utilisation ratio was less than existing customers, therefore they did not utilise their car and credit limit as much as the customers who did not churn.
